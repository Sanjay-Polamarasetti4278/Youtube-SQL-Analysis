🚀 Project Update: YouTube SQL Analysis (MySQL) 🎯

I'm excited to share a recent project I worked on: YouTube SQL Analysis using MySQL! This project helped me understand how to extract key insights from a dataset of popular YouTube channels by writing powerful SQL queries.

🔍 The analysis covered:

Channel-level performance metrics (views, subscribers, NOX score)

Video-level stats (upload dates, views, likes, comments)

Engagement tracking (likes, comments, shares)

Revenue insights (monthly & yearly)

The project involved working with four interconnected tables to answer real-world business questions using SQL — just like in a real analytics job!
